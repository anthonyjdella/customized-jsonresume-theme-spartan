# Customized JSON Resume Theme: Spartan

üñºÔ∏è This is a slightly tweaked version of the [Spartan theme](https://github.com/phoinixi/jsonresume-theme-spartan). Tweaked to fit my design preferences. Published on NPM and GitHub Registry.

## Notable Changes

* 2 Page version in PDF/printable mode 
* Added sections for speaking and articles
* Style changes

## Prerequisites

To build and start the local server, it needs to use the cli command, which is custom cli I tweaked.

`npm i @anthonyjdella/customized-resume-cli`

## How to Start

`npm run start`

## How to Change

* `resume.hbs` is the order of the resume.
* `style.css` is the styling
* To make changes to the PDF/printable version, make changes in the `@print` section of `style.css`
* Change version number in `package.json`
* Deploy the changes via `npm publish --access public`
* To see changes from `resume.anthonydellavecchia.com` you need to go to the [registry project](https://github.com/anthonyjdella/customized-registry-functions), then cd into `functions`, run `npm i` and `npm update`, then `firebase deploy`.
